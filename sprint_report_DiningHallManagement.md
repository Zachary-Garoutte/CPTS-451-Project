## What's New (User Facing)
 * Log-In Page
 * Account Creation
 * Error and sucess messages

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We have set up the basics of the backend of our project. We were able to set up a database using azure and connected it to our project. We were also able to create tables that are needed for the project. We were also able to set it up as winforms to make the production of the pages easier. 

## Unfinished Work
We ran out of time to finish the account managment, Feedback collection system, and Log in verification. We had not anticipated the amount of trouble we would habe setting up azure and connecting it to our app. We did not know when we first started that we needed to give our server rules for the firewall to allow our ip adresses. We will be finishing these issues next sprint
